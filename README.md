## How to collaborate?

1. Look for an issue to work on in the [GitHub issue tracker.](https://github.com/JhonnGutierrez/Sidey/issues) If you can't find an issue that suits you, create a new issue and tell us in it that you want to solve it.

2. Fork the project on GitHub.

3. Create a new branch from the "develop" branch. This ensures that your changes don't interfere with the main codebase.

4. Make changes to the code in your local branch.

5. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates your forked repository with your changes.

6. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the "develop" branch of the original repository. This asks the project maintainers to review your changes and merge them into the main codebase.

7. Wait for the maintainers to review and merge your PR. Be patient and wait for the maintainers to review your changes. They may ask you to make further changes before they merge your changes into the main codebase.
